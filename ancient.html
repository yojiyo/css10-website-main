            The ancient Middle Eastern civilizations made significant advances in warfare, 
            law and order, and science. They have, however, succumbed to the challenges of 
            deforestation, soil erosion, and salt accumulation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Simeria was a prosperous and thriving civilization about 2700 BC. However, by 
            2100 BC, the civilization had collapsed to bad land management. As these 
            civilizations moved north towards Assyria and Babylonia, they didn't appear to 
            learn and kept making the same mistakes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Troy encountered a similar predicament in 1200 BC. Throughout the Trojan rule, 
            deforestation and erosion caused the shoreline to change regularly. Only when 
            this development was taken into consideration was the city found in 1870.
          </p>

          <p>
            Simultaneously, the Greek coastal settlements immediately east of Troy were 
            becoming landlocked as soil erosion and sedimentation increased.
          </p>

          <p>
            Central American city states followed the beautiful heritage of eroding soils 
            all over the planet. From 1700 to 1500 BC, civilizations flourished and 
            perished slowly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Indeed, the issues of soil erosion appear to have afflicted civilizations that 
            had developed advanced agricultural systems in association with excessive 
            deforestation. Both were a direct outcome of increasing population, and both 
            contributed to the final downfall of that society.
