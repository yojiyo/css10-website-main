            Recent findings by an international study team show that people have been 
            influencing the earth since well before the Industrial Revolution. Human 
            activities have already greatly exacerbated soil erosion near lake basins 
            on a worldwide basis some 4,000 years ago. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The findings necessitated a multidisciplinary approach, with many sorts of 
            analysis providing a more comprehensive picture of how human activities may 
            be contributing to the accelerating erosion.
          </p>

          <p>
            The study's primary author, Jean-Philippe Jenny, a French geoscientist 
            associated with the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry and the Alpine 
            Center for Research on Trophic Networks and Liminic Ecosystems, evaluated 
            core sediment samples from 632 lake beds gathered from across the world. Lake 
            sediment cores can be utilized as a natural archive of oscillations in soil 
            erosion throughout time since sediments build at a constant pace in lakes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jenny and his colleagues extrapolated changes in lake sedimentation accumulation 
            rates by combining sediment rates with radioactive carbon dating data from 
            each site and discovered that 35% of the tested lakes have accelerated erosion 
            over the previous 10,000 years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interestingly, the acceleration in erosion began approximately 4,000 years 
            ago, and the researchers investigated methods to explain this pattern, 
            concluding that people were the most likely culprit. Researchers discovered 
            that changes in erosion were less connected to changes in precipitation and 
            temperature, but increases in deforestation correlated with the rise in erosion. 
            Jenny and his colleagues studied pollen samples from each lake bed location 
            to provide a proxy for adjacent land tree coverage; they discovered that losses 
            in tree cover were strongly associated with increased erosion. "At the time, 
            deforestation was caused by humans since they were only starting to create 
            agriculture," Jenny explained.
