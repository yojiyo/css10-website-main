          <p>
            Humanity has stolen land from the forest to cultivate in order to feed the 
            world's growing population and to create homes, factories, and other structures. 
            Deforestation occurs when trees are cut down on a big scale for these reasons. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Logging destroys trees that prevent soil erosion. The roots of the trees hold the 
            soil together, while the canopy of the trees protects the soil from heavy rain and 
            wind. Logging destroys the forest floor by removing leaf litter, or dead leaves, 
            bark, and branches. Leaf litter is essential for preventing soil erosion in forests. 
            Without plant cover, erosion can occur, sweeping land into rivers and lakes, filling 
            estuaries, and burying coral reefs. 
          </p>

          <p>
            In reality, vegetation is one of the most effective techniques for preventing erosion. 
            It decreases surface runoff, allowing for improved water uptake into the soil. It also 
            protects soil from rainfall and breaks down wind before it can reach the soil with full 
            force. And nothing keeps soil together better than a healthy plant's deep root system. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The agricultural plants that frequently replace trees are unable to hold onto the soil 
            of these increasingly high-demand commodities from a rising population, such as coffee, 
            cotton, palm oil, soybeans, and wheat, and can actually aggravate soil erosion. As land 
            loses its fertile soil, agricultural producers relocate, remove more forest, and the cycle 
            of soil loss continues.
