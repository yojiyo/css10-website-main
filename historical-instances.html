          <p>
            One would believe that soil erosion has only been a concern since we 
            began modifying age-old agricultural techniques by utilizing pesticides 
            and mass-producing crops to feed the world's rising population. 
            That, however, is not the case. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Soil erosion by water and wind has occurred naturally since the 
            Silurian Period when the first land plants generated the first soil. 
            Accelerated erosion has a very recent geological origin; nevertheless, 
            accelerated erosion is quite old on a human timeline. There is substantial 
            archaeological evidence from various regions of the world that suggests 
            that rapid erosion by water is frequently related to early agriculture. 
            In reality, all civilizations throughout history have struggled with soil 
            erosion and have fallen as a result.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ancient Middle Eastern civilizations made significant advances in 
            warfare, law and order, and science. They have, however, succumbed to 
            the challenges of deforestation, soil erosion, and salt accumulation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Simeria was a prosperous and thriving civilization in about 2700 BC. 
            However, by 2100 BC, the civilization had collapsed to bad land management. 
            As these civilizations moved north towards Assyria and Babylonia, they 
            didn't appear to learn and kept making the same mistakes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Troy encountered a similar predicament in 1200 BC. Throughout the Trojan rule, 
            deforestation and erosion caused the shoreline to change regularly. Only when 
            this development was taken into consideration was the city found in 1870.
          </p>

          <p>
            Simultaneously, the Greek coastal settlements immediately east of Troy were 
            becoming landlocked as soil erosion and sedimentation increased.
          </p>

          <p>
            Central American city-states followed the beautiful heritage of 
            eroding soils all over the planet. From 1700 to 1500 BC, 
            civilizations flourished and perished slowly.
          </p>

          <p>Indeed, the issues of soil erosion appear to have afflicted civilizations 
            that had developed advanced agricultural systems in association with excessive 
            deforestation. Both were a direct outcome of the increasing population, and both 
            contributed to the final downfall of that society.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jared Elliot noticed soil erosion for the first time in the contemporary world 
            in 1685. He documented his views in a series of writings, and he was particularly 
            worried about water rushing down barren hillslopes. He was among the first in his 
            time to perform soil conservation studies. He planted green crops to firm up and 
            nourish the soil, as well as grasses and legumes for animal management.
          </p>

          <p>
            While the West continued to adopt bad soil practices, human settlements in the East, 
            particularly China and India, recognized the need for soil preservation and implemented 
            many modern conservation strategies such as terracing, crop rotation, and the use of 
            natural fertilizers. Early British immigrants documented their initial views of these 
            places' steep slopes lined with terraces for cultivation.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, western influences, along with the necessity to feed an ever-increasing 
            population, have compelled these countries to abandon their ancient ways in favor 
            of the short-term rewards of contemporary techniques.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most important reason why history will continue to be significant as long as 
            humans exist is to avoid repeating the same mistakes. However, for some reason, 
            people tend to make them in innovative and significant ways.
          </p>

          <p>
            Soil erosion and deforestation have claimed the lives of innumerable civilizations, 
            including some well-known ones. If the existing world's agricultural system fails 
            over and over, not only a civilization will purge into chaos but the whole world.
