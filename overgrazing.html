          <p>
            Overgrazing is caused by excessive livestock raising. Grazing animals graze on 
            grasses and bushes in huge regions of pasture or natural grasslands. Grazers 
            expose soil by eliminating plant cover from a specific region. With their hooves, 
            they also churn up the soil. When too many animals graze in the same area, the hooves 
            of the animals pull the plants out by their roots.  
          </p>

          <p>
            This loosens the soil, making it prone to erosion. Overgrazing can remove the ground 
            cover, allowing wind and rain to erode and compress the terrain. Plants are crushed 
            and compacted by cattle because they do not have the necessary recovery period.	
          </p>

          <p>
            Converting natural ecosystems to pasture land may not immediately harm the land as 
            much as crop cultivation does, but this change in usage can result in significant 
            rates of erosion and loss of topsoil and nutrients. 
          </p>

          <p>
            As for the remaining soil, it may lose its infiltration capability, reducing the 
            ability of plants to grow and water to permeate, harming soil bacteria, and causing 
            severe erosion of the land. This also implies that more water is being wasted on 
            the environment, making it more difficult for new plants to thrive.
